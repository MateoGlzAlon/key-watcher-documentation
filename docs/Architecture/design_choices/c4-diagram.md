# C4 Diagram Introduction

The **C4 Model** is a visual framework for describing the architecture of software systems. It breaks down the system into four hierarchical levels:

1. **Context**: Provides a high-level overview showing users and external systems interacting with the system.
2. **Container**: Focuses on the system's main components (e.g., web apps, databases).
3. **Component**: Details the internal structure of each container, including services and APIs.
4. **Code (Optional)**: Represents the implementation details of specific components.

The C4 model simplifies architectural diagrams by emphasizing clarity, scalability, and context, making it easier for technical and non-technical stakeholders to understand system design.
